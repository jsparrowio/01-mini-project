UofM/edX Coding Bootcamp - Mini Project 1

## Description

This was the first of many mini-projects we will complete for the UofM/edX Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. It was completed to practice our skills with basic-intermediate HTML and CSS. It helped teach use of semantic HTML, proper HTML formatting, along with CSS selectors (universal, tag/type selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors), properties, and rules.

## Usage

No specific usage intended. Only used as an example page to help understand writing HTML elements, along with customizing them with CSS.
